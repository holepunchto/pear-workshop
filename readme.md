Welcome to the [Pear Runtime](https://github.com/holepunchto/pear) Workshop.

## Requirements

* `npm` is used to install project dependencies so Node.js with `npm` is required

## Setup

Pear is not built on Node. It's just easy to use Node to bootstrap Pear if Node is already installed.

If Node & npm are installed Pear can be bootstrapped on the command-line with:

```sh
npx pear
```

Once installed run `pear run pear://runtime`. This will open a new window that shows Complete Pear Setup. Click it. Setup complete. Open a new terminal and run `pear`. Pear help should be output.

# Exercise 6 - Connecting Peers

This is a group exercise.

> **CAUTION**: DO NOT RUN UNTRUSTED PEAR LINKS

Run a stage and seeded Pear Application from another peer

```sh
pear run pear://<key>
```

Create or Join a topic in the chat app and start chatting.

There are two layers of peer-to-peer connection happening here.

The first layer is a Pear application that is deployed from a peer and run from a peer.

The second layer is the application itself, which lets peers connect and chat.
